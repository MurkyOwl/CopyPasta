# CopyPasta


CopyPasta takes the contents of your clipboard(when you hit "ctrl+c") and sends them through [Evepraisal's](https://evepraisal.com/)API to return the sell value, buy value and the volume, as well as a link to the specific appraisal.

## Hit ctrl+c twice to get the result

this is due to `trigger_on_release=True` not actually working so we have to run on the KeyPress down before your content is in the clipboard.
