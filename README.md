# CopyPasta


CopyPasta takes the contents of your clipboard (when you hit "ctrl+c") and sends them through [janice's](https://janice.e-351.com/) API to return the sell value, buy value and the volume, as well as a link to the specific appraisal.

## Keyboard 0.11.0 Required

This is due to "trigger_on_release=True" only working on 0.11.0, and not the most recent version.

## Stuff used with this program
